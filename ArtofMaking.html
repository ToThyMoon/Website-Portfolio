              MazeCraze is a video game console my team made using LittleBits - a system of circuit components broken into magnetic parts. The video is displayed on 4 LED matrices programmed to work in sync. The game has 4 levels each being custom mazes with moving enemies inside. I mainly worked on the programming and circuitry of the game.

              Interactive Tetris was a project I did as part of the Tangible User Interface project. We had Play-Doh connected to an Arduino that was able to play Tetris by touching the Play-Doh.

              The Hero Hand was a wrist-mounted launcher for the Wearables project. At the press of a button, a small dart would launch from your wrist like a superhero. I worked on the electronics and programming of the Hero Hand.

              Scholardarity was my Art of Making Capstone. The goal of the project was to help students study by providing incentives. To do this, we set up a website that tracked the score of participants. Initially, we wanted to focus on controlling distracting stimulation while studying. However, we ran into issues with our problem being to vague. We were able to focus on a single aspect with the help of our mentor/TA. I worked on the backend, which was a spreadsheet that kept track of each person's score and updated in real time.
