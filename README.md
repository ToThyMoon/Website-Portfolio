# Website-Portfolio
The website will serve primarily as a platform to show off my job-relevant skills, with miscellaneous projects such as the soundscape and visual argument included. The design is in it's very basic form right now. The colors are not final and the text is filler for now. The basic design is implemented: lists of my skills. 
In the future, I want to fill out the information.
